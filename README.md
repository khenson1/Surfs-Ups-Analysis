According to the results:
- The mean, max, and the standard deviation are all very close in temperature, varying only on average 1.82 degrees.
- The minimum temperatures for both June and December are surprisingly low.
- The count in June is 2000 more than the count in December
## Summary
The temperature is consistently stable throughout the year. With these results, we can confidently say that the surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable year-round. Some additional queries to perform would be to provide month-to-month temperature and weather statistics. Even if the temperature is ideal, the weather may not be. Surfing during a thunderstorm is not ideal, and there may be a month where thunderstorms are common. Knowing this information would be essential for the shop.
